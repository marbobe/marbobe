## About Me

I'm a passionate **DAW (Web Application Development)** student with a strong interest in building robust and scalable applications. My focus is on **backend development**, but I enjoy working across the full stack to bring ideas to life. I love solving complex problems and I'm always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills.

I am currently seeking an internship or junior developer role where I can contribute to real-world projects and grow as a developer.
